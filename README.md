# Authors App - Full Stack
> Created an application where users submit their favorite authors. Listing all the authors on the /authors page. From there, the user may click on a button to edit or delete each author. 
  The edit form is pre-populated with the existing data for the author.
  Used backend validations to ensure that all author names are at least three characters long. If the user does not pass validations, an error message is displayed. Validations are also applied when editing an author.
> Live demo [_here_](https://www.example.com).
